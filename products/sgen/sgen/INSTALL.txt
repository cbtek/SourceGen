Compiling
---------------------------
SourceGen uses Qt5 and CMake 2.8.12.2 or higher. 
It also comes with a few C++ utilities that are statically compiled

WINDOWS and MACOS:

1) Install the latest version of CMake.
2) Download and install the latest version of QtSDK
3) Launch QtCreator and load the top-level CMakeLists.txt file using the "Open File or Project" command 
4) The CMake setup dialog will be displayed; Select a location to put your executables and click next
5) For CMake arguments enter: -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
6) Click "Run CMake"
7) Click "Finish"
8) Press "CTRL+B" or click the Build Icon (Hammer)
9) Click the Play button to run 



LINUX:
Install Qt5 for your platform then just run CMake.

If you are on a Debian-based distro then installing the following should install all required libs:

1) sudo apt-get install libqt5declarative5 qt5-default qtchooser
2) Navigate to SigSourceGen/common
3) Run cmake ..
4) Run make -j8
5) Executable sould be SourceGen/sourcegen
